# make-make v3
A repo initializer, mainly for Epitech, but customizable.

It comes with handy Makefiles for projects and libraries.

## What the "make-make" script does:
1) Make a standard programming project arborescence
2) Put useful Makefiles in the repo's root and in lib/my/
3) Create an empty main.c file in src/
4) Set the binary output name for the passed argument

## Installation :
1) Download the repo and run install.sh (works for bash and zsh users)
2) Copy the .c files you want in your initial lib in ~/bin/make-make_files/make-makelib/
3) Copy your library header (.h) in ~/bin/make-make_files/make-makelib/ and call it my.h
4) Your make-make installation is complete. Do not forget to restart your terminal once before using make-make.

## Upgrade :
Just run upgrade.sh !

## Uninstallation :
