# make-make v3.5
A repo initializer, mainly for Epitech Tek1 students, but easily customizable.

It comes with handy Makefiles for projects and libraries.

## What the "make-make" script does:
1) Make a standard programming project arborescence
2) Put automated Makefiles for your lib and your project (you don't even have to open it !)
3) Put a pre-made main.c file in src/ and open it automatically
4) Set the binary output name for the passed argument (a.out if no arguments)

## Installation :
1) Download or clone the repo (big green button up here)
2) Run the install.sh file (no need to sudo)
3) Put your lib .c files and my.h in the ~/bin/make-make_files/make-makelib folder
4) You're done ! Just restart your terminal once.

## Upgrade :
- Run upgrade.sh

## Uninstallation :
- Run uninstall.sh :(
